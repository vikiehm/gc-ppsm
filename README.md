# Partial-to-Partial Shape Matching with Geometric Consistency

This repository contains the code of the paper 
"Partial-to-Partial Shape Matching with Geometric Consistency", V.Ehm, M.Gao, P. Roetzer, M. Eisenberger, D. Cremers, F. Bernard. CVPR 2024.
It provides code to solve the partial-to-partial shape matching problem utilizing geometric consistency. 

It consists of two main folders: 
- `processing` (in Python): Preprocessing and Postprocessing of shapes. 
- `matlab`: Matlab code to solve the partial-to-partial shape matching approach, which is based on [1,2,3]. 


## Prerequisites for Processing
Add a conda environment 
````
conda create -n gc-ppsm python=3.8
conda activate gc-ppsm
````
Add additional requirements
````
pip install -r processing/requirements.txt
````

## Prerequisites for Partial-to-Partial Shape Matching
- YALMIP 
- Matlab
- Gurobi (for Matlab) 
- Run the setup_matlab() file (Adjust the path to the repo beforehand)

## Run the Code 
- Run `matlab/call_main.m` to solve the partial-to-partial shape matching problem on low resolution
- Run `processsing/gen_high_res_mat.py` to generate the high resolution solution based on the given low resolution solution
